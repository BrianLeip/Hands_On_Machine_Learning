# 01 - THE MACHINE LEARNING LANDSCAPE
## I. What is Machine Learning
add notes later if needed, most of this internalized already
***
## II. Why use Machine Learning
add notes later if needed, most of this internalized already
***
## III. Types of Machine Learning
* Training Methods
  1. Supervised
  2. Unsupervised
  3. Semi-supervised
  4. Reinforcement Learning

* Learning Style
  1. Batch learning / offline learning (cannot learn incrementally)
  2. Incremental learning / Online learning / mini batches (can learn incrementally on the fly)

* Analysis type
  1. Instance Based (specific and not generalized)
  2. Model Based Learning / pattern recognition (generalized)

#### Examples of Popular Supervised Learning Algorithms
- k-Nearest Neighbors
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Decision Trees and Random Forests
- Neural Networks

#### Examples of Popular Unsupervised Learning Algorithms
* Clustering
  - K Means
  - Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA)
  - Expectation Maximization

* Visualization and Dimensionality Reduction
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - Kernal PCA
  - Logically Linear Embedding (LLE)
  - t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)

* Association rule learning 
  - *Purpose: Dig into large amounts of data and discover interesting relationships and attributes*
